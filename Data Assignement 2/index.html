<p>One form of transportation happened to soar during the pandemic and its jump in use was clear to see in New York City’s Time Square.
</p>
<p>Time Square has one of the largest amounts of foot traffic out of anywhere in New York City but like most of the city, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a huge cut in the amount of people walking through its lit up streets but what did not go down is bike traffic.
</p>Around 360,000 people enter Times Square per day according to the <a href="https://www.timessquarenyc.org/do-business/market-research-data/pedestrian-counts">Times Square Alliance.</a> The number is based on the automated tickers that have been placed in times square in 2011 counting footraffice per day. But in 2020 the number went down to 125,000 per day.
<p>On one of  Broadway's most  populated locations the drop in foot traffic is just as clear.  Broadway and 51st near the Broadway ticket machine which used to have lines down the block before the pandemic and is also near many broadway theaters that also closed their doors in 2019 and just re-opened in september of this year, showed a 85% decrease in foot traffic from its may 2019 total compared to the October 2020 total according to NYC Dot data.

  <p>Pedestrian totals on 51st and Broadway are taken on a bi yearly basis and due to covid 19 were not taken at the same month each year, as they usually like to do.</p>

  <p>Times Square was still a place to stroll through if you were on a bike.
50th street and broadway saw a bicycle traffic increase of 17% in September 2020 compared to September of the previous year, an increase than seen in at least the past 5 years according to NYC dots automated ticker data.

<p>Due largely to a massive infrastructure push in the 90’s, New York City has seen a steady increase in bicycle usership over the last 2 decades according to NYC Dots 2021 <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/cycling-in-the-city-2021.pdf">Cycling Trends</a> round up. The city has been making biking more accessible every year with 29.5 lane-miles of protected bike lanes installed in 2020 alone. On top of that, a widely reported nationwide cycling boom was sparked due to the pandemic in 2020.
